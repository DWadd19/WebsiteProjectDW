            <font size="4">
                I will be using Visual Studio for producing my website as it has very useful
                functionality such as predictive text, function templates, and debugging
                capabilities. Visual Studio also has extendions that allow for the addition
                of extra fucntionality, editting abilities, UI appearance, etc.
                Codepen is also a useful tool as it combines the 3 main web
                creation languages in one: HTML, CSS, Javascript. It also runs on browser
                so one can do work across platforms. Trello will be used to plan and track
                project development. To-do lists are important for the efficient running
                of a project. They allow timely reminders of the steps that need to be
                taken and also promote effective time management.

        </h3>
        <p>
            <font size="4">
                I have been very happy with Visual Studio Code as the compiler of choice.
                Its predictive text is very helpful and time efficient. Also the ability to read
                and write in many different languages on the same platform, HTML and CSS in
                particular, is very useful.

            <br> - <em> are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the
                website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?
            </em></h3>

        <p>
            <font size="4">
                I have been pleased with the website. However, I would have liked to have spent more
                time on perfecting CSS and making my website more pretty but I am pleased that I
                have learnt HTML and CSS in a very short time. CSS does seem to be an artform more
                than a science and does require practice. I shall continue practicing html and css
                for the future.

            <font size="4">
                I would like to improve my CSS skills in order to make my website appear as professional
                as possible. In particular, the use of box links, dropboxes and hyperlinks. Also
                incorporating more images and background effects would be a priority.

                The website is now running and I have managed to introduce stylising effects using CSS.
                I have managed to include interactive features into my webpage, such as buttons.
