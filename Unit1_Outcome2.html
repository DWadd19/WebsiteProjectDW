        <h3><b>2.1 </b>Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed
            <br> - <em> in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? </em> </h3>
        <p>
            <font size="4">
                I will be using Visual Studio for producing my website as it has very useful
                functionality such as predictive text, function templates, and debugging
                capabilities. Visual Studio also has extendions that allow for the addition
                of extra fucntionality, editting abilities, UI appearance, etc.
                Codepen is also a useful tool as it combines the 3 main web
                creation languages in one: HTML, CSS, Javascript. It also runs on browser
                so one can do work across platforms. Trello was used to plan and track
                project development. To-do lists are important for the efficient running
                of a project. They allow timely reminders of the steps that need to be
                taken and also promote effective time management. However, I would have
                liked to make better and more widespread usage of Trello as it has a very
                good reputation in project organization and time management. I believe it also
                psychologically beneficial to see your work progressing and having it ticked off
                your to-do list.

        <h3><b>2.2</b> Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate
            <br> <em> e.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello </em>
        </h3>
        <p>
            <font size="4">
                I have been very happy with Visual Studio Code as the compiler of choice.
                Its predictive text is very helpful and time efficient. Also the ability to read
                and write in many different languages on the same platform, HTML and CSS in
                particular, is very useful. However, Codepen became a bit redundant during the
                latter phase of the course because Visual Studio Code is much more of a powerful
                IDE software, with readability of many coding languages. The IDE is also clear and uncomplicated.
                Perfect for coding quickly and useful colour markers for keywords, functions bracket matching.
                 Trello was also used, but to
                a limited degree. It can be seen that the application has great power, especially in
                collaborative roles. I would most definitely use this web-app in future, particularly in
                large projects with many roles and sections.

                I have been pleased with the website. However, I would have liked to have spent more
                time on perfecting CSS and making my website more pretty but I am pleased that I
                have learnt HTML and CSS in a very short time. CSS does seem to be an artform more
                than a science and does require practice. I shall continue practicing HTML and CSS
                for the future. Strengths during the project include my ability with Javascript, having never
                used it before. I did however have previous experience with programming, especially the basics
                of coding, such as conditionals, objects, loops, etc. Programming syntax in general. Again,
                if I had further time to work on the website, I would have spend a lot more timely
                experimenting with the css code and trying to add more and more sophisticated effects.
                I was pleased however with more drop-down menu functionality and its link to the units.

        </h3>

        <p>
            <font size="4">
                As mentioned previously, I would spend a lot more time planning the design of my website.
                Building up a pre-coding plan for how the final website will look. I can then write a
                more detailed break down of the task in Trello. I would therefore also be able to
                research the CSS code I would need to integrate. The aesthetics of the website would be a
                priority.
                I would like to improve my CSS skills in order to make my website appear as professional
                as possible. In particular, the use of box links, dropboxes and hyperlinks. Also
                incorporating more images and background effects would be a priority. I would also like to 
                improve the HTML and CSS code to make the code more readable and 'inline'. Possibly the addition
                of comments too to help 'future-proof' the code so that I remember how the code works, if I come
                back to it a a later date. Forgetting code functionality is a common problem with programmers!

        <h3> <b>2.5</b> Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose.
        </h3>

        <p>
            <font size="4">
                The website is now running and I have managed to introduce stylising effects using CSS.
I have gathered multimedia items, such as my profile picture, to head my blog page. I was then able to 
integrate the correct code to use an image in HTML. I could then adjust the size of the photo using width and height 
attributes. I was also able to look up independently and confidently online further css attributes, from
websites such as MDN and W3School. These sites contain a library of functions and tags with examples of
how to use. I, for example, used a W3School example on drop-down menus to make my own top menu bar. I had
chosen this because it was a neat way to allow sub sections to be chosen, without the need to display
excessively long menu options on the top bar. Since Unit 1 had 3 Outcomes, it seemed the perfect choice
to employ in my webpage. I was able to follow the example and change over relevant links (href) and class
names to match my HTML and CSS code. 

                I have managed to include interactive features into my webpage, such as buttons. I had to
                test these thoroughly to make sure all links worked in all situations. This was done after
                every update to make sure nothing was mistakenly erased during editting. I found thorough
                hard experience that forgotten, misplaced or mistakenly deleted tags were a common source of
                error or formatting issues. This was something I learnt to look and check for after every 
                iteration. I believe my HTML and CSS coding and debugging methodology has improved 
                through this experience. All pages of my webpage now work error free.
