  <h3> About Me </h3>

  <p>
    <font size="4">My name is David Waddicor and I am 38 and from Manchester, England. I am a physics graduate
      with 15 years experience. I also have a passion for coding, to solve real world science problems, 
      web design, and general fun. 
    </font>
  </p>

  <h3> My Background </h3>

  <p>
    <font size="4"> I spend my early years in my home city of Manchester but my family and I soon moved
      to South Africa when I was 2 years old, as my Dad had found work there. We stayed there
      two and a half years before returning to Manchester. At age 8 we again embarked on
      another overseas adventure when my Dad got a job with aircraft manufactures
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas" target="_blank">McDonnell-Douglas</a> in the US.
      This was a year of great vivid memories for me as we lived in Sunny California and joined school in the US!
      I met many Americans and also children of other immigrants and foreigners, which was an enlightening
      experience. We returned in 1989 to Manchester.

  </p>

  <p>
    <font size="4">The next significant chapter in my live was when I went to the
      <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Manchester</a>
      to study Physics. A subject that has always fascinated me. I followed this up with a Masters in Fluid Dynamics.
      I decided to do the complete set study for my PhD in an area of Physics that was of great Interest
      to me, Atmospheric Science, because of its real-world relavance and impact on the natural world.

      In 2014 I moved to Tarragona, Catalonia, Spain to work in a renewal energy research institute. 
      I used programming code quite often during this time, mainly to do data analysis and data visualisation.
      MATLAB was our main program of choice.

  <h3> My Interest in Coding </h3>

  <p>
    <font size="4">

      My interest in coding began as a result of exposer at University as I studied physics. What began as
      a necesity (and struggle!) turned into a passion and interest in the power of coding. Number one, to make
      life easier! But as my science career developed I gained increasing familiarity with coding and respect
      for its data analytic capabilities. I began using programming daily to complete tasks and to analyse data
      and then visualise it graphically. I began learning C initially as a core unit but soon expanded into
      the classic code of FORTRAN, which is still used by a lot of numerical analyst scientists
      and mathematicians for its numerical stability. That led onto the procurement of programming languages for
      graphical visualisation and
      data analysis such as MATLAB, IDL and python. Now coding is an integral part of my working life
      and it is fascinating to learn new techniques and plan out complicated projects. I believe my greatest
      achievement is to code an aerosol nucleation model for my atmospheric science thesis. It was based on
      a multi-stage complex physics model and I had only limited time in which to code, test, run and then
      produce results from the project. I was able to do this while entering the last 6 months of my PhD
      deadline, which encompassed the writing of my final thesis.

  <h3> Reason for joining Code Nation </h3>

  <p>
    <font size="4">
      I now have a good grounding in programming and the fundamentals and methodology of making code work
      the way you want, syntax insight being a useful tool to have. I did not, however, have any background or
      training in web development, an area of huge importance in the digital world, and only growing larger.
      I felt a keen interest in learning this valuable skill to, not only improve my employability, but to,
      due to my love of programming, enjoy making my own exciting web projects. Code Nation have an excellent
      training programme for programmers of all abilities and were a logical choice to get my web development
      initiation underway.
