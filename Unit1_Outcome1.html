        <p>
            <font size="4">
                IT and the computers involved help to facilitate the operations of modern business by making
                communication (between staff, management, customers and partners), inventory of business products,
                storage of data, information management of staff and customers for example. Furthermore,
                data analysis is an increasingly important tool in modern business with successful companies
                employing computer statistical software and learning algorithms to best target their potential
                customer market and increase revenue. App creation is also a huge sector in any digital
                business as it is a way for customers to communicate and reach out to your business in the
                quickest and most convenient way.

            <br> - <em> do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</em>
        </h3>
        <p>
            <font size="4">
                Digital projects require a whole range of resources to complete successfully and it is
                constantly evolving and changing. Today, no business could survive without web based analysts.
                Computers and statistical software are vital to analyse trends in buyer traffic and web
                searches. A successful digital project will also require a team of people with a range of roles
                within a project with a team leader to organise resources and guide the direction of the project
                and allocate relevant personnel to the right areas. There is a whole range of roles within a
                modern digital project: understanding digital strategy, customer experience, user experience,
                business analysis, design, copywriting, SEO, development, QA, and analytics. Key to modern
                digital business is the internet as it provides a way to connect client and customer as well
                as providing a window into buyer trends around the world. Digital and data analysis is also
                a key tool in modern digital businesses, using statistical and visualisation software such
                as R, python and MATLAB. Data management tools such as SQL are also a vital resource for
                quickly and effectively sorting, moving and organising data.

        <h3><b>1.3</b> Plan and carry out tasks using IT
            <br> - <em> e.g. making your website. How will you plan it?

            </em>
        </h3>
        <p>
            <font size="4">
                Trello is a fantastic project management tool that allows ease of collaboration. It works like an online notice board where you add notes for tasks. These can be updated
                as progress is made. Trello tells you what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a process. It is like virtual sticky notes for your project.
                I have used the <a href="https://trello.com/b/bb4YVXQr/new09032020">Trello</a> board to help plan and keep good time management for the project. I have tried to make notes as 
                specific as possible without being too lengthy and/or cryptic. It is also important
                to keep plans updated because even the best plans have some failures amongst the 
                successes. This is where the flexibility of Trello comes to the fore. Notes can 
                contain comments and using these can greatly improve the readbility of task notes and 
                help collaborators.

        <h3> <b>1.4</b> Describe the risks that might impact digital projects
            <br> - <em> what causes digital projects to fail?</em></h3>

        <p>
            <font size="4">
                The major reason for digital project failure is poor planning and poor management.
                Preparation is key for the success of any venture and digital work is no exception.
                As mentioned in section <b>1.2</b> and the successful running of projects, the proper distribution
                of resources is vital. Misdirecting staff and misplacement of talent for a given role can
                be fatal to the successful conduct of a project. Ventures can fail due to reliance on
                untested methods and tools, broad expertise in multi-disciplines, not just reliance on
                â€˜digital peopleâ€™, as rigid plans and timeframes can hinder innovation and initiative.
                Poor planning can also lead to projects being overambitious and therefore failing to
                meet targets. Mentioning many of the issues above <a href="https://www.celerity.com/5-reasons-digital-projects-fail-the-forgotten-role-of-business-process">Celerity.com</a> goes into some of the reasons for failed projects, including, lack of cross-functional expertise, fixed plans that don't account for change and limited
                digital strategy.

    <h3> <b>1.5</b> Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software

        <br> - <em> how do you select the right kind of technology for the job? </em></h3>

    <p>
        <font size="4">
            To select the right digital software and technologies for your job requires the strategy
            team to consider what their desired end goals will be. If you can see what your results
            will look like you can choose the right tools for the job. If you will be producing digital
            data then statistical and graphical software would be necessary, for visualisation of data
            and presentability of results to a broad audience. You also need to take into account the
            ease of use of the software and whether it fits into the skillset of your staff and if not,
            will you need to train up your staff or recruit new employees? This is something that might
            affect spending costs on the project, and therefore profit margin. If the overhead of new
            software is too high for minimum improvements in efficiency then this must be considered
            carefully by management. The tools already available might already be perfectly adequate.
            Choosing the right IT technologies for the job, again, requires good planning with clear
            set outcomes envisaged.

        <h3> <b>1.6</b> Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your
            outcomes.

            <br>- <em> How has trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes
                version control
            </em></h3>

        <p>
            <font size="4">
                The chosen technologies have aided my work very much. The Integrated Development Environment (IDE), Visual Studio Code, has been very useful becuase it makes everything
                easily available, such as the file explorer sidebar, allowing me to click, view and browse my root folder and files without trouble. The IDE also has a very handy predictive script editor that suggests commonly used functions and keywords or a tab 
                autocomplete facility. 
Trello has really helped me to manage my time and to keep track of all the sections required for the 
project. The 'sticky' notes and progress markability is very handy. I have not had any collaborative experience so far with Trello but I any told it is one of its strong points and reason for being so popular. Usage of the collaboration abilities of Trello would most likely come to the fore in any subsequent project. 
<a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> again has been introduced as a powerful workload sharing website. It allows coders to have a public work folder, from where teammates and collaborators can access and work on the project files. I have used it during this project to share my final website design, including the source files. Again, this is a very powerful work sharing website.

        <h3> <b>1.7</b> Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects

            <br>- <em> How does GDPR impact digital projects? </em></h3>

        <p>
            <font size="4">
                The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has a huge impact on the legal running of current
                digital businesses. Web-based content and user data has to be legally protected by all digital
                companies, to avoid theft of data for example. Loss, theft or wrongful sale of data can have
                serious repercussions for customers digital security. Data has been a major issue in recent
                years with companies unlawfully sharing user data and targeting internet users with tracking
                cookies. This has caused web-based businesses to conduct their work much more carefully with
                consent required for data usage (such as the acceptance of the use of cookies to target
                customers). GDPR now affects the way businesses can use mailing lists. Whereas previously
                companies made money from buying and selling mailing lists this has been tightened up in
                GDPR so that the customer has the right to refuse data sharing. Consent is the key to
                the relationship between online businesses and customers with websites now required to
                ask permission or â€˜acceptanceâ€™ of websiteâ€™s data practices. Ultimately, GDPR regulates
                two areas of digital operations: data gathering and profiling and secondly, Targeting.
                The law now regulates that digital companies allow a customer or user to refuse or
                object to data usage, in particular data sharing. Companies must also now operate
                with much more transparency; clients must be clearly informed of the processing
                of their data and for what marketing purposes it will be used for.
