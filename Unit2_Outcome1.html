                I will have a page that is â€˜about meâ€™ a personal profile page which describes my
                personality and work ethic. I will have a banner or photo to act as the header
                image of my website. A professional picture of myself and the office environment.
                A following page that contains my portfolio and work experience and projects.
                This will also include images of my website designs as promotional material.
                The website will also contain pages of my qualifications and a contact page.

                To use images from other companies will be copyright restricted so will require clearance if I want to
                add them to the website. Also the use of clients websites as part of the portfolio would require
                permission from the client.

                For disabled customers such as partially sighted or with blindness could be
                accommodated by use of screen reader and speech recognition. High zoom possibilities
                up to 200%, even 300%. The use of descriptive audio that explains pictures and other
                graphical content to users who may struggle to see it. Also the ability to
                increase volume to level acceptable for deaf or hard of hearing users. W3C
                is a website that explains all the user-friendly features a website may
                include to help disabled customers and viewers.

                <font size="4">
                    The number one file type that integrates with html and is in fact indispensable
                    for modern web design is .css files. This provides a lot of the presentability
                    to websites and gives a user-friendly appearance. There is then .avi for audio
                    and visual files, .jpg and .png files for images. For html supported image
                    files and motion loops the .gif file type can be used and for any executable
                    software, the .exe file type is necessary.
