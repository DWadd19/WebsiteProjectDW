        <p>
            <font size="4">
                I will have a page that is â€˜about meâ€™ a personal profile page which describes my
                personality and work ethic. I will have a banner or photo to act as the header
                image of my website. A professional picture of myself and the office environment.
                A following page that contains my portfolio and work experience and projects.
                This will also include images of my website designs as promotional material.
                The website will also contain pages of my qualifications and a contact page. 
                Using large bold fonts will also be a priority as will simplicity as that has been
                shown to be more effective at atttracting customers, rather than busy and messy
                web pages. Using a resume as your homepage to sell yourself is also a good idea. It
                promotes a degree of familiarity between you and the client. A degree of creative
                graphic design is also a useful trick to employ as visual cues are known to keep 
                viewers on your page longer.

        <h3><b>1.5</b> Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites.
        </h3>
        <p>
            <font size="4">
                To use images from other companies will be copyright restricted so will require clearance if I want to
                add them to the website. Also the use of clients websites as part of the portfolio would require
                permission from the client.
                A web designer can employ a number of methods to try and safeguard his or her website from
                copyright infringement issues. <a
                    href="https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/website-permissions/websites/">Stanford University</a>
                goes into a number of points were a website can protect itself. Number one, assume that everything is
                potentially
                protected. Just because it is on the internet do not assume it is in the public domain. Two, read
                click-wrap agreements.
                These are the links that often pop up "click to agree" when opening or downloading a file. It is
                important to read
                all terms and conditions. Three, remove unauthorised material immediately. If a complaint is lodge the
                offending
                item should be removed, while an investigation is undertaken. Even if you are in the right, removal
                should be
                done as standard, while you seek legal advise. Four, further to point 3, all complaints should be
                investigated immediately. Failure to do so could make legal issues more severe and more
                costly. Five, if in doubt, seek permission directly and get written consent.

                For disabled customers such as partially sighted or with blindness could be
                accommodated by use of screen reader and speech recognition. High zoom possibilities
                up to 200%, even 300%. The use of descriptive audio that explains pictures and other
                graphical content to users who may struggle to see it. Also the ability to
                increase volume to level acceptable for deaf or hard of hearing users. W3C
                is a website that explains all the user-friendly features a website may
                include to help disabled customers and viewers. <a href="https://mashable.com/2014/04/22/website-disability-friendly/?europe=true">MashableUK</a>
goes into detail of some tips for making user-friendly features for disabled users.
Using alt tags which show a pop up text when the cursor is hovered over an image or certain text word
can be a great help for the visually impaired. Subtitles and transcripts are also very helpful for the hard
of hearing. Abbreviating in HTML, it is helpful to put periods between the letters, for example C.I.A. As 
a continuous word can confuse a screen reader. Allowing colour control is another helpful aid for people
who have colour blindness.

        <h3> <b>1.7</b> Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites. </h3>

        <p>
            <font size="4">
                The number one file type that integrates with html and is in fact indispensable
                for modern web design is .css files. This provides a lot of the presentability
                to websites and gives a user-friendly appearance. There is then .avi for audio
                and visual files, standard video format supported on the windows platform. They do not stream, however, so you have to download
                 the entire file before you can watch any of it. Jpg and .png files for images. For html supported image
                files and motion loops the .gif file type, being the first lossless internet compatible media format,
                 can be used and for any executable
                software, the .exe file type is necessary. MP3 files are highly compressable music files that
                are ideal for sharing and distribution.
