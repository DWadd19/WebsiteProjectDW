        <h3><b>3.1</b>Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and
            efficiency 
        <br> - <em> could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?
        </em> </h3>
        <p>
            <font size="4">

                IT tools are effective in making code writing quicker and more simplified. The predictive text,
                autocomplete and templates make writing code easier for the user. However, this does have the drawback
                in making the user unaware of certain syntax issues. Whereas learning by heart can increase the general
                knowledge of the programming language in question. More effective website design could have been
                undertaken by reviewing the trello posts more often and splitting tasks up into smaller parts. This is
                where a team could have increased productivity: assigning smaller tasks to different people. With good
                leadership, a team should be able to outcompete an individual worker.

        </h3>
        <p>
            <font size="4">
                Productivity can be increased by having a good pre-planning stage. This is where Trello comes in. With
                proper foresight and an idea of how the final product will appear (the website) then the task of
                breaking down the project into smaller steps is simpler. Trello and good old fashioned pen and paper
                allow notes and planning to be done effectively. Having an end goal in sight is vital.

        <h3> <b>3.3</b> Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects
            <br> - <em>what would you do next time? Team work? Use of slack?
            </em></h3>

        <p>
            <font size="4">
                Doing a digital project again, I would try to make use of work colleagues. This could be done
                effectively by slack. Talking with workmates for pointers and possible solutions to obstacles that one
                faces during a project are important. IT tools do help streamline the process of writing code,
                particularly the tag and function templates. But using teamwork would definitely be the number time
                saving measure that one could employ.

    <h3> <b>3.4</b> Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions?
    </h3>

    <p>
        <font size="4">
            A digital solution implies that the project is almost 100% computer-based. This requires excellent browser
            skills to look for solutions to problems online. Testing would also make use of comparing to other projects
            online. Debugging and checking every step of the programming procedure is vital. In previous coding
            exercises I have tried to test every step of the code with written output, for example.
