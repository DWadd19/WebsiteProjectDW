        <h3><b>3.1</b>Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and
            efficiency 
        <br> - <em> could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?
        </em> </h3>
        <p>
            <font size="4">

                IT tools are effective in making code writing quicker and more simplified. The predictive text,
                autocomplete and templates make writing code easier for the user. However, this does have the drawback
                in making the user unaware of certain syntax issues. Whereas learning by heart can increase the general
                knowledge of the programming language in question. More effective website design could have been
                undertaken by reviewing the trello posts more often and splitting tasks up into smaller parts. This is
                where a team could have increased productivity: assigning smaller tasks to different people. With good
                leadership, a team should be able to outcompete an individual worker.

        <h3><b>3.2</b> Describe ways to increase productivity and efficiency?
        </h3>
        <p>
            <font size="4">
                Productivity can be increased by having a good pre-planning stage. This is where Trello comes in. With
                proper foresight and an idea of how the final product will appear (the website) then the task of
                breaking down the project into smaller steps is simpler. Trello and pen and paper
                allow notes and planning to be done effectively. I would definitely use Trello much more widely
                in a future project, especially a collaborative undertaking - this is where Trello comes into its own
                  Having an end goal in sight is vital. 
                One major obstacle to smooth running of a project and hence productivity is the juggling
                of too many tasks. This can be a problem when one flits between different tasks fequently
                within the same day, even if it is in the same project. This prevents the mind focusing and 
                ultimately leads to unfinished jobs that tend to build up as the deadline comes into sight.
                Psychologically it is always a positive to finish a task and 'tick' it off the list. 
                Become an expert on your chosen software and devices, such as Visual Studio Code in this case.
                Use all the shortcuts and employ them regularly. So rather than using many different softwares,
                I would try to become profficient in my chosen software tools and apps, Visual Studio Code, Trello and
                GitHub. I would also make sure to be flexible with initial plans, reporting and changing failing 
                avenues of work and adjusting the plan as it goes forward, if necessary. Informing work colleagues
                regularly of failures and success would be a priority to avoid wasted time and effort.

        <h3> <b>3.3</b> Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects
            <br> - <em>what would you do next time? Team work? Use of slack?
            </em></h3>

        <p>
            <font size="4">
                Doing a digital project again, I would try to make use of work colleagues. This could be done
                effectively by slack. Talking with workmates for pointers and possible solutions to obstacles that one
                faces during a project are important. IT tools do help streamline the process of writing code,
                particularly the tag and function templates. But using teamwork would definitely be the number time
                saving measure that one could employ. This coursework and project has shown us the power of 
                update boards and IT message boards such as slack and GitHub. A modern IT project will need to use
                all these resources. We have been given a good introduction into the use of slack in the 
                IT working environment and would feel confident in using it in the future.

    <h3> <b>3.4</b> Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions?
    </h3>

    <p>
        <font size="4">
            A digital solution implies that the project is almost 100% computer-based. This requires excellent browser
            skills to look for solutions to problems online. Testing would also make use of comparing to other projects
            online. Debugging and checking every step of the programming procedure is vital. In previous coding
            exercises I have tried to test every step of the code with written output, for example. I found that
            during editting there was the risk of deleting or misplacing tags and other punctuation. This would 
            in formatting errors. This taught me to check all page links at every iteration. The use of Visual Studio
            Code formatting ability was very helpful (right-click - format document). This adjusted everything so that it
            would be 'inline'. This made it very easy to check if all tags had a beginning and end tag and that 
            they were in the right place. 
        </font>
    </p>

    <p>
        <font size="4">
Testing digital solutions means checking that the customer or browser of your website is having a fulfilling
experience. This means that as well as carefully debugging and check each stage of the process. It is important
to involve others in the design process. Testers, another pair of eyes, can give a fresh perspective to your
website. Test the usability this way is an excellent way to find bugs or problems with navagability.
